This is the first challenge we built for the first [frida-wars](https://sec-r.et/).

Credits for the awesome work to @jeanbmar @bhargavhegde001 @veronicapablo @AkshayJainG and @iGio90

The goal is to read from memory a String with that format: 
**{secRet-[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]}**

We ensure, as per competition rule, that the flag is built in memory when an action is perfomed by the user and no external tools is altering the execution.


#### Guidelines
